Automatic, and accurate screening of dental radiographs utilizing deep learning techniques has been a key focus of research in the current dental radiology space. However, the easy availability of large annotated datasets for such deep learning initiatives has been a challenge for various compliance-related reasons. The objective of this project is the utilization of image augmentation techniques on a panoramic radiograph dataset to generate additional data required for training a deep learning model. Subsequently, M Faster R-CNN method is implemented on this data for automatic tooth identification and tooth numbering processes. The results and performance of the technique is evaluated with the help of evaluation metrics.
